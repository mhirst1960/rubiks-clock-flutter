# Rubik's Clock

A clock that shows the time of day on a Rubik's Cube.

## Runs everywhere

This app is implemented in flutter and dart.  Therefore it can be run on Windows, Mac, iOS, and HTML browser.

## A new gif every minute

The app is quite simple.  Every minute it displays a new gif of a Rubik's Cube decorated with numbers.  The gif transforms the cube from the previous time of day to the new time of day using legal Rubik's Cube moves.

The gifs are generated from "screen shots" from my Raspberry Pi application that can be found here: https://github.com/mhirst1960/rubiks-clock
